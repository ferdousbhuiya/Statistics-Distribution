    "#### Q: Explain the four fundamental pillars of OOPs in detail.\n",
    "#### Ans:\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The four fundamental pillars of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "* Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is often achieved by making attributes private and providing public getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and only exposes what is necessary for the object's use. This helps to protect the object's integrity by preventing outside code from making uncontrolled changes.\n",
    "* Public Interface: The class provides a public interface through methods that interact with its private data. This ensures that data can only be modified in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction\n",
    "* Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplification: By using abstraction, you can simplify complex systems by focusing on high-level operations and hiding the underlying details.\n",
    "* Abstract Classes and Interfaces: In many OOP languages, abstraction is implemented through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes can define abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance\n",
    "* Definition: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). It allows for code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code Reusability: By inheriting from a parent class, a child class can reuse the code from the parent, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "* Hierarchical Relationships: Inheritance models real-world relationships where subclasses extend or specialize the behavior of parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "* Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to operate in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Method Overloading: In some languages, polymorphism allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to exist within the same class.\n",
    "* Method Overriding: Inheritance allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "* Dynamic Method Resolution: Polymorphism is often implemented through dynamic method resolution, where the method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the objectâ€™s type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "* Encapsulation protects an object's state and provides a controlled interface for interacting with it.\n",
    "* Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "* Inheritance promotes code reuse and models hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "* Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, enabling flexible and interchangeable code."

    "#### Q: Explain the fundamental differences between a while loop and for loop in python. In what scenarios is one preferred over the others?\n",
    "#### Ans:\n",
    "* In Python, both while loops and for loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, but they are suited to different scenarios based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "while Loop\n",
    "* Definition: The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Condition-Based: It continues to execute as long as the condition is True. If the condition is initially False, the loop will not execute at all.\n",
    "* Potential for Infinite Loop: If the condition never becomes False, the while loop can result in an infinite loop. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the condition will eventually become False.\n",
    "* Use Cases: It is preferred when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on some dynamic condition that is evaluated during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "for Loop\n",
    "* Definition: The for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or an iterable object, executing a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequence-Based: It iterates over a sequence or iterable and executes the block of code for each item. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the sequence.\n",
    "* No Need for Manual Increment: The for loop automatically iterates through each item of the iterable, eliminating the need to manually manage the loop counter.\n",
    "* Use Cases: It is preferred when you know beforehand the sequence of items over which you need to iterate or when you are iterating through collections of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: Both loops are powerful, but choosing between them depends on whether you need to iterate over a sequence or conditionally execute code. The for loop is generally preferred for its clarity and simplicity in iterating over known sequences, while the while loop is useful for scenarios where the iteration depends on dynamic conditions."
